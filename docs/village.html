					As you approach the village you can hear the sounds of everyday life.
					From your experience you know there is a blacksmith that works in the village 
					providing goods and tools to local farmers and serfs, hopefully he may have some arms and armour. 
					Also, there are some travelling hedge knights camped on the outskirts who may be able to improve 
					your skill at arms, and a tavern where you could try and gain knowledge of the bandits.
				</p>	
				<p id='knowLocationText'style="font-size:18px;">
					You know the bandits are camped somewhere in the forest. You could go searching for them or you could 
					try to learn their precise location in the village
