			You stand in the ashes of your farmhouse. 
			After a morning of toil in the fields you arrive home to find your home burned to the ground and your father gently swinging from a nearby tree, a rope around his neck. A small sign hung around his neck reading “CHEAT”.  Your wife lies nearby on the ground, motionless and bloody, a wide wet gash on her neck, slowly oozing blood, her still open eyes staring lifelessly at the sky.
		</p>
		<p class="storyText">BANDITS WORK.</p>
		<p class="storyText">
			Your father spoke of these bandits the previous night and how they accused him of cheating at dice at the tavern in town after he beat them.
			How your wife became their second victim, you will never know.
			Regardless, you gather up your savings of 100 silver coins and your pitchfork and load them on your horse, you know what you must do.
			You must find these bandits and exact your REVENGE.
