					As you push your way through the rest of the brush and into the clearing you see a bandit 
					sitting by a fire. He rises and turns to face you with his spear in his hand, you hear a 
					commotion from a nearby run-down cottage, his companions must be stirring to also challenge you. 
					Hopefully, you can dispatch the solo bandit before his friends become a problem. Will youâ€¦
